# TUI Library

This is a basic terminal user interface (TUI) library written in Rust. It provides a set of widgets for building interactive command-line applications. It's not a crate, or anywhere near finishing (it doesn't even provide event handling for buttons), but it's mainly just a proof of concept and a hobby project.

You can currently:

1. Add labels
2. Add sliders
3. Add checkboxes
4. Add buttons
5. Handle events (for sliders and checkboxes)
